1. Start PostgreSQL with Docker Compose
Once your docker-compose.yml file is ready, you can use Docker Compose to start the PostgreSQL container.

    1. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder containing docker-compose.yml.
    2.  Run the following command to start the container:

```
docker-compose up -d
```


    - The -d flag runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
    
    - This will pull the PostgreSQL Docker image (if not already available) and start the container.
